  <h2>About Stronger by the Plate</h2>

  <p><strong>Stronger by the Plate</strong> is more than just a website — it’s a wellness movement built around the idea that the path to a long, healthy life begins with what’s on your plate. Inspired by the world’s Blue Zones — regions known for the highest concentrations of centenarians — we promote a lifestyle rooted in nutritious eating, joyful movement, and genuine social connection.</p>

  <h3>Our Mission</h3>
  <p>Our mission is to empower individuals of all ages to take control of their health by making sustainable, informed choices about food and fitness. We believe that small daily actions, like preparing a wholesome meal or taking a walk with friends, can have a powerful impact on overall well-being.</p>

  <h3>What We Believe</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Plant-Forward Eating:</strong> Most of your plate should be filled with vegetables, fruits, legumes, and whole grains — foods that fuel longevity and reduce disease risk.</li>
    <li><strong>Mindful Movement:</strong> We support consistent, enjoyable physical activity that fits your lifestyle, from yoga and strength training to walks in nature.</li>
    <li><strong>Community Connection:</strong> Wellness isn’t just physical — social bonds and emotional support are essential to a happy, long life.</li>
    <li><strong>Accessible Health:</strong> Everyone deserves access to information and tools that help them thrive — regardless of age, ability, or background.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Who We Serve</h3>
  <p>Whether you're starting your wellness journey or looking to refine your habits, Stronger by the Plate provides tools, education, and inspiration for anyone seeking better health. Students, busy parents, retirees, athletes, or anyone in between — you're welcome here.</p>

  <h3>Our Promise</h3>
  <p>We aim to be a trustworthy source of wellness knowledge that prioritizes balance, not extremes. We’ll never promote crash diets, unrealistic body standards, or one-size-fits-all fitness plans. Instead, we celebrate progress, not perfection — and we’re here to help you every step of the way.</p>
